\chapter{Implementation}
\section{Overview}
This part of the documentation describes how the project was implemented in more-detailed and technical manner. It shows some of the key approaches that were used to solve some of the major conversion obstacles. It explains what kind of data OSM contains and how that data was used in conjunction with the plugin to produce an XML document compliant with the NeTEx schema. As we know, OSM data is not very consistent, since it's updated by the community, which means that a lot of extra measures and conditions had to be taken in order to avoid and solve problems of data inconsistency.\\
This section will also cover some of the important techniques and tools that were used to test, document the plugin, generate artifacts from the plugin etc. It will also cover the code repository and the CI/CD aspects, which for this application, were hosted/maintained on project called \href{https://gitlab.com/}{GitLab}, which is hosted under an open-source license.
\section{OpenStreetMap Data}
Elements (or objects) are the basic components of OpenStreetMap's conceptual data model of the physical world. They consist of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Nodes (defining points in space)
	\item Ways (defining linear features and area boundaries)
	\item Relations (which are sometimes used to explain how other elements work together).
\end{itemize}
All of the above can have one or more associated tags (which describe the meaning of a particular element). \cite{OSMElements}
\subsection{Data Types}
\label{sec:OSMDataTypes}
\subsubsection{Node}
A node represents a specific point on the earth's surface defined by its latitude and longitude. Each node comprises at least an id number and a pair of coordinates.\\
Nodes can be used to define standalone point features. For example, a node could represent a park bench or a water well.\\
Nodes are also used to define the shape of a way. When used as points along ways, nodes usually have no tags, though some of them could. For example, \textit{highway=traffic\_signals} marks traffic signals on a road, and \textit{power=tower} represents a pylon along an electric power line.\\
A node can be included as member of relation. The relation also may indicate the member's role: that is, the node's function in this particular set of related data elements. \cite{OSMElements}
\subsubsection{Way}
A way is an ordered list of between 2 and 2,000 nodes that define a polyline. Ways are used to represent linear features such as rivers and roads.\\
Ways can also represent the boundaries of areas (solid polygons) such as buildings or forests. In this case, the way's first and last node will be the same. This is called a "closed way".\\
Note that closed ways occasionally represent loops, such as roundabouts on highways, rather than solid areas. The way's tags must be examined to discover which it is.\\
Areas with holes, or with boundaries of more than 2,000 nodes, cannot be represented by a single way. Instead, the feature will require a more complex multipolygon relation data structure. \cite{OSMElements}
\subsubsection{Relation}
A relation is a multi-purpose data structure that documents a relationship between two or more data elements (nodes, ways, and/or other relations). Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A route relation, which lists the ways that form a major (numbered) highway, a cycle route, or a bus route.
	\item A turn restriction that says you can't turn from one way into another way.
	\item A multipolygon that describes an area (whose boundary is the 'outer way') with holes (the 'inner ways').
\end{itemize}
Thus, relations can have different meanings. The relation's meaning is defined by its tags. Typically, the relation will have a 'type' tag. The relation's other tags need to be interpreted in light of the type tag.\\
The relation is primarily an ordered list of nodes, ways, or other relations. These objects are known as the relation's members.\\
Each element can optionally have a role within the relation. For example, a turn restriction would have members with "from" and "to" roles, describing the particular turn that is forbidden.\\
A single element such as a particular way may appear multiple times in a relation. \cite{OSMElements}

\subsection{Usage of OpenStreetMap Data}
All the OpenStreetMap data types explained in the \hyperref[sec:OSMDataTypes]{Data Types} can represent various transport-related objects. These data types can represent various transport-related information for the plugin:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {A node can represent a bus station, a bus stop, a train station, elevators near train stations etc. }
	\item {A way (be that closed or open ways), can represent footpaths near stations, various steps or ramps that are located in the train station that lead to train platforms, bus platforms etc. They can also represent bus platforms or even train platforms in some cases.}
	\item {A relation has children, those children can be of any type, they can even be relations themselves. Relations represent train platforms, bus routes, train routes and require special care from the plugin in order to serve their purpose.}
\end{itemize}
All of this OSM data is contained in the JOSM editor and the plugin has access to JOSM interfaces in order to manipulate such data, which is of course, necessary for the conversion.\\
The plugin initially checks every visible element within the JOSM map layer and checks their tags. Their tags then represent what kind of an element that is and if it is relative to our plugin. After that, the plugin finds the relative elements and their type, and then depending on the type, different NeTEx objects are created. While the NeTEx objects are being created, the conversion algorithm adds various attributes to those objects depending on the tags that they contain, what they are close to and their importance to the related transport information. Different elements that are found at later stages can be related to previously identified relative elements, when that happens, the algorithm finds the connection of those elements and relates/fixes them accordingly.
\section{Java OpenStreetMap Editor}
Java OpenStreetMap Editor is an open-source desktop application written in Java that is used in order to edit OSM content in a more advanced/professional manner. The source code of JOSM is hosted in the \href{https://subversion.apache.org/}{Apache Subversion (SVN)} version control system and is compiled and built using the \href{https://ant.apache.org/}{Apache Ant} Java library and command-line tool.\\
\newline
First, the project must be cloned in the target machine using SVN or Git and then must be compiled using Ant, which will create a .jar file, containing the JOSM application, hosted locally on your machine. The JOSM project has a directory called \textit{\textbackslash plugins} which contains all of the available JOSM plugins. Every plugin contains a \textit{build.xml} file which contains the common Ant building information, plus some mandatory fields for the plugin, such as: The plugins version, the entry point (main class) of the plugin, its minimum Java verison, the plugin icon etc. If you want to register and publish a plugin in the official JOSM plugin repository, a set of procedures must be followed before that is possible. The benefit of that is that the plugin will be available to the whole JOSM community and other developers might fix bugs or improve the code.\\
\newline
JOSM has a plugin API that must be imported as a package from your plugins main class and then there are specific methods and entry points that the plugin must implement in order for JOSM to take the necessary steps into initializing the plugin. These methods can specify anything, some of them are required and some of them are optional. With the help of this API, you can set the plugins location, its icon, its name, whether its disabled/enabled initially etc.

\section{XML Binding Framework}
NeTEx is a general purpose XML format designed for the efficient exchange of complex transport data among distributed systems. In order to write such XML in a programmatic manner, there must exist a model which is written in the intended language that represents the components of such format, their attributes and their interrelations.\\
In this case, since the plugin is written in Java, a Java model of the NeTEx schema is required for coding. To achieve such a thing, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_XML_Binding}{Jakarta XML Binding (JAXB)} framework was used.\\
\newline
Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) provides a fast and convenient way to bind XML schemas and Java representations, making it easy for Java developers to incorporate XML data and processing functions in Java applications. As part of this process, JAXB provides methods for unmarshalling (reading) XML instance documents into Java content trees, and then marshalling (writing) Java content trees back into XML instance documents. JAXB also provides a way to generate XML schema from Java objects . \cite{WhatIsJAXB}\\ 
It simplifies access to an XML document from a Java program by presenting the XML document to the program in a Java format.
\subsection{The Binding Procedure}
The official NeTEx schema is taken from the official NeTEx \href{https://github.com/NeTEx-CEN/NeTEx}{GitHub Repository} using a batch file which downloads the schema (.xsd file) and using the JAXB files and configuration, creates the corresponding Java classes for each NeTEx object and it's relations.\\
After this whole set of classes are generated (which are put into a Java package), they are bundled together with the plugin code in order to generate a single .jar file at the end, which is of course, executable using the JOSM editor.\\
The framework generates a lot of Java classes and sub-packages that lead to pretty heavy content, which implies that the ultimate .jar file is not a light-weight .jar file but rather a relatively heavy one (~10MB). This package of generated classes is then imported by the plugins main conversion classes and used accordingly in order to enable the conversion process. After the conversion is completed, the whole NeTEx content is then "marshalled" into XML content and written in an XML file that is compliant with the official NeTEx schema.\\
As of now, there are a total of 2,704 generated files from JAXB.
\newpage
Some of the generated classes from JAXB (for the Stop Place):

\end{figure}
\newpage
\section{NeTEx Conversion}
The main technical approaches and key points used to convert OSM data into NeTEx are described in this section.\\
\newline
The plugin initially processes and reads all of the loaded elements in the JOSM map layer (Nodes, Ways, Relations) and carefully checks if any element is relative to any NeTEx object. When that happens, the plugin creates a NeTEx object from it using a separate "parser" class (but not all of the relative elements initially). The algorithm for converting the data into NeTEx is contained in the \textit{NeTExExport.java} class, which is the class containing the heavy logic of the conversion process. \\
This class contains logic such as: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Finding the relative OSM elements for NeTEx.
	\item Calling the appropriate methods for parsing such objects into NeTEx.
	\item Logging different relative information during the NeTEx conversion.
	\item Accumulating them so that at the end of the conversion, they are appended to the JOSM objects, which are then highlighted after the conversion is completed.
\end{itemize}
First, the plugin identifies only the OSM elements that correspond to NeTEx \textit{StopPlace} objects. After all of these are created (which are the top parent nodes), then we re-iterate through the OSM elements, trying to find other important elements such as: platforms, elevators, footpaths, steps etc. A lot of ambiguities and discrepancies are resolved while these loops are being executed. All the relevant information and children of a \textit{StopPlace} are mapped and resolved here, accumulating them all together and then assigning them to their corresponding \textit{StopPlace} using the generated NeTEx classes from the JAXB framework.\\
\newpage
Portion of code loop that iterates through all of the visible OSM elements and tries to identify the relevant elements:
\begin{minted}[tabsize=2,breaklines]{java}
for (OsmPrimitive primitive : primitives) {
	if (primitive instanceof Node) {
	Node node = (Node) primitive;

	if (OSMHelper.isTrainStation(node)) {
		stopPlaces.put(node, neTExParser.createStopPlace(node, StopTypeEnumeration.RAIL_STATION));
	}
	else if (OSMHelper.isBusStation(node)) {
		stopPlaces.put(node, neTExParser.createStopPlace(node, StopTypeEnumeration.BUS_STATION));
	}
	else if (OSMHelper.isBusStop(node)) {
		stopPlaces.put(node, neTExParser.createStopPlace(node, StopTypeEnumeration.ONSTREET_BUS));
	}
	else if (OSMHelper.isPlatform(node)) {
		quays.put(node, neTExParser.createQuay(node));
	}
	else if (OSMHelper.isElevator(node)) {
		elevators.put(node, neTExParser.createElevator(node));
	}
...
}
\end{minted}
A lot of conditions are available in the algorithm because of the OSM data inconsistency. The plugin tries to "solve" or "mitigate" such inconsistency by providing log messages at the end of the conversion, which, if fixed, make the data more consistent in general and benefit the NeTEx conversion a lot. Some warnings are more critical than the others.\\
\newpage
Portion of code extracted that shows the generation of the accumulated warning messages:
\begin{minted}[tabsize=2,breaklines]{java}
for (PrimitiveLogMessage logMessage : LOG_MESSAGES) {

	OsmPrimitive primitive = ds.getPrimitiveById(logMessage.getPrimitiveId(), logMessage.getPrimitiveType());

	if (primitive != null) {
		Logging.warn(tr("Warnings found for the {0} with the id: {1}",
			primitive.getType(), Long.toString(primitive.getId())));

		primitive.setHighlighted(true);

		for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : logMessage.getKeys().entrySet()) {
			primitive.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
		}
	}
}
\end{minted}

\section{Testing}
This plugin has been unit tested with the \href{https://junit.org/junit5/}{JUnit} testing framework.\\
The unit testing that was done here mainly consisted of testing the JAXB marshaller, the NeTEx java model classes, some XML validations etc.
\subsection{Unit Testing}
In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. \cite{WhatIsUnitTesting} \\
The Unit Testing for this project has been done using the \href{https://junit.org/junit5/}{JUnit} testing framework. JUnit is a framework to write repeatable unit tests. It is an instance of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit}{xUnit} architecture. It is one of the most popular unit testing frameworks for Java.\\
\newline
The unit testing for this plugin was mainly done to test features such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Marshalling and unmarshalling of Java objects into XML (for NeTEx)}
\item{Validating the XML content at the end of the conversion}
\item{Creating a complex dummy train station and testing the Java classes generated from JAXB}
\item{Writing XML content into a file etc.}
\end{itemize}
The unit testing classes are stored in a separate package (possibly complete folder separation in IDE) and have some other commands compared to the normal Java packages. It is very important and efficient to let the IDE know what your test folder is and what your main folder is, so that the IDE knows how to treat them accordingly.

\section{Code Repository and the CI/CD Pipeline Feature}
\label{sec:GitLab}
The code repository and the CI/CD pipeline features for this project were provided by \href{https://gitlab.com/}{GitLab}.\\
GitLab is a DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a lot of things like: Git-repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD pipeline features, it uses an open-source license and is developed by \href{https://about.gitlab.com/company/}{GitLab Inc}.
It has a very nice web interface and lots of different features that make application lifecycle much easier. The features GitLab offers that were used for this project were the project repository and the CI/CD feature.\\
\newline
CI/CD, or continuous integration and continuous delivery (aka continuous deployment), combines the values of these two practices in order to provide precise integration and delivery.
GitLab has a feature of writing a CI/CD file (.yaml format), which does various operations for you each and every commit, to make sure that the CI/CD configuration still works with the committed changes.\\
TBD... (FIX) In this case, CI/CD was used to test the project (run the unit tests) and then generate and upload the documentation PDF into an artifact which can be downloaded from the CI/CD pipeline itself.

\section{Document Preparation System}
The typesetting system that was used in order to document this project was \href{https://www.LaTeX-project.org/}{LaTeX}.\\
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software. \cite{WhatIsLaTeX}\\
The application that was used in conjunction with LaTeX was \href{http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/}{TeXstudio}.
TeXstudio is an integrated writing environment for creating LaTeX documents. Our goal is to make writing LaTeX as easy and comfortable as possible. Therefore TeXstudio has numerous features like syntax-highlighting, integrated viewer, reference checking and various assistants. \cite{WhatIsTeXStudio}\\
The reason why LaTeX was used is that it is very convenient to developers, since they can get used to the syntax very quickly and are familiar with "coding" approaches. Another big reason is that it provides a lot of packages for displaying code in a nice formatted way, it has the ability of displaying web links in a nice manner and also the figures and figure alignments are very appropriate and easy to create \& maintain.\\
A taste of LaTEx: \cite{LaTExExample}
\begin{minted}{latex}
\documentclass[12pt,twoside,a4paper]{article} 
\begin{document} 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} 
\hline 
A & B & C \\ 
\hline 
1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
\hline 
4 & 5 & 6 
\\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular} 
\end{document} 
\end{minted}
This would produce the following output:
\begin{figure}[H]
